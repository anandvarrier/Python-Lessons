What is a Python Script, Module, Package and a Library?
    -> Script is a python code which will give you an output when you run that code. You can consider it as a code which contains main function, 
       which directly gives ouput when you run it.
    -> Module is a python code BUT which contains functions or objects whcih will be imported in python scripts. These are python files which is basically imported.
    -> Package is a directory/folder which contains multiple Scripts and Modules along with a __init__.py file. This file tells the interpretor that the directory 
       is a Package.
    -> Library is a collection of multiple Packages. eg. matplotlib is a library with multiple packages. These packages contain multiple modules and sub-modules which can be
       imported in the code.
       
       
       
Steps to Push a code from your computer to Github repository

Step 1: Open a terminal from the directory where your code is located.
Step 2: Type -> git init -> This will iniliaize the pushing the code 
Step 3: Type -> git add <name of file> -> type the name of file to add the file you desire
Step 4: Type -> git commit -m "comment if any" -> This will commit the file that you want to add 
Step 5: Type -> git remote add origin <copy the path of the git repository here> -> you will find the link when you go to the repository page and click on code button.
Step 5.1: Type -> git remote set-url <copy the path of the git repository here> -> this line is used when you have already pushed a code earlier and now you want to add another file. You need not set up a path again.
Step 6: Type -> git push -u origin <folder name you have given> -> it coud be master or main or any name if the folder you want to add.

You haave successfully pushed a code in into a repo in Git.

Extra and important steps:
If you want to change the repo branch from master to main. The command for the same is: git branch --move master main
